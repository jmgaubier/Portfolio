                <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first website. I started my coding journey during the pandemic in 2020 but I have stopped learning because I found it difficult to not be able to have a support when I needed to.
                    Earlier this year, I have discovered this group on Meetup "Coding For Black Females"
                    So I started following them and ended up joining their community on Slack and register for the "Introduction to Web Development course".
